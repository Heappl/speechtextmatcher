What's it?
----------

This is a free Russian speech recognition database. It's collected
in order to train Russian models for free speech recognition. Thanks
a lot for everyone contributed!

We intend to develop a database for continuous free wide-band recognitions.
Everything below is recorded with a usual microphone on desktop and laptop.
The prompts are collected from license-free texts and intended to cover
generic speech.
